3. Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?

A license for an open source project allows for unrestricted development of an open source project. It allows users from the community to aid in project development without the worry of getting caught up in unspecified terms and conditions that may cause trouble for the initial author of the project and the developers themselves. It allows the users/ developers to gain a full understanding of the boundaries regarding the copyrights and other conditions of the project.





4. Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?

This is because, without a license, it is technically not legal to copy or modify the code posted by the author and the modification of code with a license may allow developers to suffer legal actions if they were not careful and had the ongoing consent of the author of the code. This risk is eliminated with the presence of a license so it is advisable to not work on projects without an explicit license.



5. Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher. Do you agree with this claim?

I agree with the claim on the Web beating Gopher due to the existance of hyperlinks being allowed in any page in Web but not in Gopher where a menu like system was used. This made it so Gopher would require more oversight from administrators and less possibility for the individual users to create pages and work through the Web. Additionally, from a convenience perspective,  it is much easier to go from one page to another rather than going back to a menu file and then finding the next page. In the end these systems were both made for consumers and the Web simply suited consumers more.



6. Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project? 

The project I chose was Linux, which uses the GPL v2 license. This license is specialized in allowing the sharing and distribution of the software in question. This definately suits the purpose of Linux as an operating system designed to be distributed and shared in various forms under huge numbers of users. This is because linux is made to be able to be modified and changed to fit the needs of groups or products and therefore this license allows a greater extent in terms of flexibility.
