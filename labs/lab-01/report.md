# Lab 01 Report - Introduction to Open Source Software

Please read Eric Raymond's article Smart Questions How to ask the question The Smart Way .

Do you have more suggestions for How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way (from your past experience)
List at least two.

I have found that one of the best methods for answering a question or having a question answered is through the use of  examples of already solved problems of the same or a similar type. While this may not be applicable to all problems, it does help with understanding what one should be doing when solving similar types of problems. Another possible suggestion is to identify the areas of knowledge or topics relevant to the question. By providing the relevant topics as well as possible sources to learn those topics, it provides questioners a starting point or direction as well as a list of necessary knowledge to answer their own questions.



Please read chapter 3 of Free Culture

Write a short paragraph ( 8 to 10 sentences) of what you got out of reading that chapter.

Chapter 3 of Free Culture focuses directly on the story of Jesse Jordan. He was a former student of RPI who faced potential  lawsuits for tinkering and modifying features on existing search engines. The chapter talks about how Jesse worked by himself to modify a search engine by fixing a bug in the Microsoft file sharing system. Up till here was fine but the chapter then transitions into the second half which focuses on how the RIAA took advantage of Jesse and filed a major lawsuit against him. The article as a whole focuses on the possible challenges or complications that can be associated with tinkering and experimenting with code. I personally believe Jesse had no fault in the matter and that this was simply targeted while pursuing his own entertainment or hobby or however you wish to refer to it. At the same time, this also shows the importance of ensuring a deree of freedom when it comes to software development and the need for a legal form of protection for personal develepment of software and code in general.

Pick an Open Source Project that might be interesting to evaluate

The open source project I have identified as a possible area of interest is called Magenta. It is a project focusing on the use of machine learning through TensorFlow to create music and other art forms. The project uses deep learning to generate various forms of art such as music, images, pictures and etc. It isn't capable of creating it's own art but is aimed to helping artists improve their ideas in terms of handling certain processes in art creation. THe project is based on Python near exclusively. I don't have experience working with TensorFlow and machine learning in general but the project itself and what they are trying to do is of definate interest to me.
